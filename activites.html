                I joined the Fraternity called Delta Tau Delta during my sophmore year. I am currently the out-of-house brotherhood chair. I create events for the house to attend that bring our brothership closer. For example I have set up:
                <ul>
                    <li>Paintbaill</li>
                    <li>Golf Outings</li>
                    <li>Bowling</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We recently built a new house.

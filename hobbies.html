                I recently started playing golf and have been devloping my game. My favorite curse to play locally is <a href="https://www.tanglewoodfulton.com/"

            <i>Motocross</i>
        </h4>
            <p>
                I grew up racing motocross and it has always been a passion of mine.
                 I started riding dirtbikes when I was 4 years old. Unfortuanitly after my father had an accident I stopped riding. 
                 However, I still follow the sport. I grew up racing against <a href="https://rxi.iscdn.net/2018/12/175595_175086_fchondadec18action-cudby-130.jpg"

            <i>Python</i>
        </h4>
            <p>
                Recently, I have been trying to become proficient in <b>Python</b>. It is commonly used in the finance industry. I think having this skill will give me and edge over my competitors.
